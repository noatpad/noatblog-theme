This is simply my hacked-up dev environment to iterate on my theme at [noat.blog](https://noat.blog).

Besides an extended template from the [Markdown cheatsheet for Bear](https://herman.bearblog.dev/markdown-cheatsheet/), it also includes the ability to paste a URL from the blog to hack it into the local dev environment for testing styles and scripts.

Start the environment with `npm start` and build your minified files with `npm run build`
